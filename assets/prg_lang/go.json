        "question": "What is the role of the 'init' function in Go?",
        "answer": "In Go, the 'init' function is a special function that is automatically called by the Go runtime when a package is initialized. It is called before the main function and can be used to perform initialization tasks for the package.\nThe 'init' function does not take any arguments and does not return a value. It is typically used to set initial values for package-level variables, establish connections to external resources such as databases, or perform any other initialization tasks that need to be performed before the main function is called.\nThe 'init' function can be defined anywhere in the package, and multiple 'init' functions can be defined in the same package. All 'init' functions within a package will be called by the Go runtime in the order they appear in the code.\n The 'init' function is a useful tool for performing initialization tasks that need to be done before the main function is called, and it is often used in conjunction with the 'main' package to set up the environment for the main function to run.

        "question": "How do you implement concurrency in Go?",
        "answer": "This is a frequently asked question in Golang basic interview questions. In Go, concurrency is implemented using Goroutines and channels.A Goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that runs concurrently with other Goroutines within the same process. Goroutines are created using the 'go' keyword, followed by a function call. For example:\ngo someFunction()\nThis will create a new Goroutine that runs the 'someFunction' function concurrently with the calling Goroutine.\nChannels are used to communicate between Goroutines and synchronize their execution. A channel is a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, '<- '. For example:\nch := make(chan int)\n go func() {\n ch <- 1\n}()\n x := <-ch\nIn this example, a new channel 'ch' of type 'int' is created, and a Goroutine is launched that sends the value '1' to the channel. The calling Goroutine then receives the value from the channel and assigns it to the variable 'x'.\nBy using Goroutines and channels, you can build complex concurrent programs in Go that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously and communicate with each other to coordinate their execution.\nIt is important to note that Go does not provide explicit control over the scheduling of Goroutines, and the actual execution of Goroutines is managed by the Go runtime. This means that the exact order in which Goroutines are executed is not deterministic, and you should not rely on any particular execution order in your code."

        "answer": "In Go, errors are represented as values of the built-in 'error' type, which is an interface that defines a single method:\ntype error interface {\n Error() string\n }\nTo create an error value, you can use the 'errors' package's 'New' function, which returns a new error value with the given string as the error message:\nimport 'errors'\nerr := errors.New('some error message')\nTo handle an error, you can use the 'if' statement and the 'comma-ok' idiom to check if an error value is nil. If the error value is not nil, it means that an error occurred and you can handle it accordingly:\n_, err := someFunction() \nif err != nil { \n// handle the error \n}"

        "question": "How do you implement interfaces in Go?",
        "answer": "In Go, you can implement an interface by defining a set of methods with the same names and signatures as the methods in the interface. Here is an example:\ntype Shape interface { \nArea() float64\nPerimeter() float64 \n} \ntype Rectangle struct { \nwidth, height float64 \n} \nfunc (r Rectangle) Area() float64 { \nreturn r.width * r.height \n} \nfunc (r Rectangle) Perimeter() float64 { \nreturn 2*r.width + 2*r.height \n}\nIn this example, the Shape interface defines two methods: Area and Perimeter. The Rectangle struct implements these methods, so it satisfies the Shape interface.\nTo use the interface, you can declare a variable of the interface type and assign a value of the implementing type to it:\nvar s Shape\ns = Rectangle{5.0, 4.0}\nYou can then call the methods defined in the interface using the interface variable:\narea := s.Area() \nperimeter := s.Perimeter()"

        "question": "What is Go programming language, and why is it used?",
        "answer": "Google created the programming language Go (or Golang) in 2007. It's a statically typed language with C-like syntax that's meant to be easy to learn and write.\nGo is designed to be a compiled language, meaning that it is transformed into machine code that can be run directly on a computer's processor. This makes it faster and more efficient than interpreted languages, which are executed at runtime by an interpreter.\nGo is a popular language for building web servers, networked applications, and distributed systems. It is also used for developing tools, libraries, and other software components.\nOne of the main reasons Go is popular is because it is designed to be easy to read and write. It has a simple, concise syntax and a small set of core language features. Go also has a strong emphasis on concurrency and parallelism, which makes it well-suited for building scalable networked systems."

Once you create an array, you can't change its size.\n\nOn the other hand, a slice is a flexible, dynamically-sized array. You can create a slice using the make function or using a composite literal. You can also create a slice from an existing array or another slice using the slice operator ([]). You can append elements to a slice using the append function, and the capacity of a slice may grow automatically as you append elements to it.\n\nOne important difference between arrays and slices is that arrays are value types, whereas slices are reference types. This means that when you pass an array to a function or assign it to a new variable, a copy of the array is made. On the other hand, when you pass a slice to a function or assign it to a new variable, only a reference to the underlying array is copied. This can be important to consider when working with large arrays or when you want to avoid copying data unnecessarily."

        "question": "How do you use the 'sync/atomic' package to perform atomic operations in Go?",
        "answer": "The 'sync/atomic' package in Go provides low-level atomic memory operations, such as atomic memory reads and writes, for use with the sync package. These operations allow you to perform atomic read-modify-write operations on variables that are shared across multiple goroutines, without the need for explicit locks or other synchronization."
