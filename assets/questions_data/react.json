        "question": "What is React?",
        "answer": "React is a declarative, efficient, flexible open source front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach for building reusable UI components, especially for single page application. It is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile apps. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially deployed on Facebook's News Feed section in 2011 and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram."

        "question": "What are the features of React?",
        "answer": "React framework gaining quick popularity as the best framework among web developers. The main features of React are:\n\n * JSX\nComponents\n\n * One-way Data Binding\n\n * Virtual DOM\n\n * Simplicity\n\n * Performance"
    },
    "3": {
        "question": "What are the most crucial advantages of using React?",
        "answer": "Following is a list of the most crucial advantages of using React:\n\n * React is easy to learn and use *\n\nReact comes with good availability of documentation, tutorials, and training resources. It is easy for any developer to switch from JavaScript background to React and easily understand and start creating web apps using React. Anyone with little knowledge of JavaScript can start building web applications using React.\n\n * React follows the MVC architecture. *\n\nReact is the V (view part) in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture model and is referred to as 'one of the JavaScript frameworks.' It is not fully featured but has many advantages of the open-source JavaScript User Interface (UI) library, which helps execute the task in a better manner.\n\n * React uses Virtual DOM to improve efficiency. * React uses virtual DOM to render the view. The virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves. That's why React provides great efficiency.\n\n * Creating dynamic web applications is easy. *\n\nIn React, creating a dynamic web application is much easier. It requires less coding and gives more functionality. It uses JSX (JavaScript Extension), which is a particular syntax letting HTML quotes and HTML tag syntax to render particular subcomponents.\n\n * React is SEO-friendly. *\n\nReact facilitates a developer to develop an engaging user interface that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which is also helpful to boost the SEO of your app.\n\n * React allows reusable components. *\n\nReact web applications are made up of multiple components where each component has its logic and controls. These components provide a small, reusable piece of HTML code as an output that can be reused wherever you need them. The code reusability helps developers to make their apps easier to develop and maintain. It also makes the nesting of the components easy and allows developers to build complex applications of simple building blocks. The reuse of components also increases the pace of development.\n\n * Support of handy tools *\n\nReact provides a lot of handy tools that can make the task of the developers understandable and easier. Use these tools in Chrome and Firefox dev extension, allowing us to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. It also allows us to select the particular components and examine and edit their current props and state.\n\n * React has a rich set of libraries. * \n\nReact has a huge ecosystem of libraries and provides you the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing the best application based on your requirement.\n\n * Scope for testing the codes *\n\nReact web applications are easy to test. These applications provide a scope where the developer can test and debug their codes with the help of native tools."

    "4": {
        "question": "What are the biggest limitations of React?",
        "answer": "Following is the list of the biggest limitations of React:\n\n * React is just a library. It is not a complete framework.\n\n * It has a huge library which takes time to understand.\n\n * It may be difficult for the new programmers to understand and code.\n\n * React uses inline templating and JSX, which may be difficult and act as a barrier. It also makes the coding complex."
    },
    "5": {
        "question": "What is JSX?",
        "answer": "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a React extension which allows writing JavaScript code that looks similar to HTML. It makes HTML file easy to understand. The JSX file makes the React application robust and boosts its performance. JSX provides you to write XML-like syntax in the same file where you write JavaScript code, and then preprocessor (i.e., transpilers like Babel) transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Just like XML/HTML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children."
    },
    "6": {
        "question": "Why can't browsers read JSX?",
        "answer": "Browsers cannot read JSX directly because they can only understand JavaScript objects, and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object. Thus, we need to transform the JSX file into a JavaScript object using transpilers like Babel and then pass it to the browser."
    },
    "7": {
        "question": "Why we use JSX?",
        "answer": "* It is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to JavaScript.\n\n * Instead of separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React uses components that contain both.\n\n * t is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.\n\n * It makes easier to create templates."
    },
    "8": {
        "question": "What do you understand by Virtual DOM?",
        "answer": "A Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which is an in-memory representation of real DOM. It is an intermediary step between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. It is similar to a node tree which lists the elements, their attributes, and content as objects and their properties. The render function creates a node tree of the React components and then updates this node tree in response to the mutations in the data model caused by various actions done by the user or by the system."
    },
    "9": {
        "question": "Explain the working of Virtual DOM.",
        "answer": "Virtual DOM works in three steps:\n\n1. Whenever any data changes in the React App, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.\n\n2. Now, the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new DOM is calculated.3. Once the calculations are completed, the real DOM updated with only those things which are changed."
    },
    "10": {
        "question": "What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?",
        "answer": "The real DOM creates a new DOM if the element updates.\n\n * Real DOM *\n\n 1.The real DOM updates slower.\n2.The real DOM can directly update HTML.\n3.The virtual DOM updates the JSX if the element updates.\n4.In real DOM, DOM manipulation is very expensive.\n5.There is a lot of memory wastage in The real DOM.\n\n\n* Virtual DOM *\n\n1.The virtual DOM updates faster.\n2.The virtual DOM cannot directly update HTML.\n3.In virtual DOM, DOM manipulation is very easy.\n4.There is no memory wastage in the virtual DOM."
    },
    "11": {
        "question": "What do you understand from 'In React, everything is a component.'",
        "answer": "In React, components are the building blocks of React applications. These components divide the entire React application's UI into small, independent, and reusable pieces of code. React renders each of these components independently without affecting the rest of the application UI. Hence, we can say that, in React, everything is a component."
    },
    "12": {
        "question": "Explain the purpose of render() in React.",
        "answer": "It is mandatory for each React component to have a render() function. Render function is used to return the HTML which you want to display in a component. If you need to rendered more than one HTML element, you need to grouped together inside single enclosing tag (parent tag) such as <div>, <form>, <group> etc. This function returns the same result each time it is invoked.\n\n1.Each render() function contains a return statement.\n2.The return statement can have only one parent HTML tag."
    },
    "13": {
        "question": "What is Props?",
        "answer": "Props stand for 'Properties' in React. They are read-only inputs to components. Props are an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data from the parent to the child components throughout the application.\n\nIt is similar to function arguments and passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.\n\nProps are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. Inside the components, we can add attributes called props. These attributes are available in the component as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method."
    },
    "14": {
        "question": "What is a State in React?",
        "answer": "The State is an updatable structure which holds the data and information about the component. It may be changed over the lifetime of the component in response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. It must be kept as simple as possible."
    },
    "15": {
        "question": "Differentiate between States and Props.",
        "answer": "* Props *\n\n1.Props are read-only.\n2.Props are immutable.\n3.Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.\n4.Props can be accessed by the child component.\n5.Props are used to communicate between components.\n6.The stateless component can have Props.\n7.Props make components reusable.\n8.Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.\n\n * State * \n\n1.State changes can be asynchronous.\n2.State is mutable.\n3.State holds information about the components.\n4.State cannot be accessed by child components.\n5.States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.\n6.The stateless components cannot have State.\n7.The State cannot make components reusable.\n8.The State is internal and controlled by the component itself."
    },
    "16": {
        "question": "How can you update the State of a component?",
        "answer": "We can update the State of a component using this.setState() method. This method does not always replace the State immediately. Instead, it only adds changes to the original State. It is a primary method which is used to update the user interface(UI) in response to event handlers and server responses."
    },
    "17": {
        "question": "Differentiate between stateless and stateful components.",
        "answer": "* Stateless Component *\n\n1.The stateless components do not hold or manage state.\n2.It does not contain the knowledge of past, current, and possible future state changes.\n3.It is also known as a functional component.\n4.It is simple and easy to understand.\n5.It does not work with any lifecycle method of React.\n6.The stateless components cannot be reused.\n\n* Stateful Component * \n\n1.The stateful components can hold or manage state.\n2.It can contain the knowledge of past, current, and possible future changes in state.\n3.It is also known as a class component.\n4.It is complex as compared to the stateless component.\n5.It can work with all lifecycle method of React.\n6.The stateful components can be reused."
    },
    "18": {
        "question": "What is arrow function in React? How is it used?",
        "answer": "The Arrow function is the new feature of the ES6 standard. If you need to use arrow functions, it is not necessary to bind any event to 'this.' Here, the scope of 'this' is global and not limited to any calling function. So If you are using Arrow Function, there is no need to bind 'this' inside the constructor. It is also called 'fat arrow '(=>) functions."
    },
    "19": {
        "question": "What is an event in React?",
        "answer": "An event is an action which triggers as a result of the user action or system generated event like a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, etc. In React, the event handling system is very similar to handling events in DOM elements. The React event handling system is known as Synthetic Event, which is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser's native event.\n\nHandling events with React have some syntactical differences, which are:\n\n  * React events are named as camelCase instead of lowercase.\n  * With JSX, a function is passed as the event handler instead of a string."
    },
    "20": {
        "question": "What are synthetic events in React?",
        "answer": "A synthetic event is an object which acts as a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It combines the behavior of different browser's native event into one API, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault()."
    },
    "21": {
        "question": "what is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
        "answer": "* Controlled *\n\n1.It does not maintain its internal state.\n2.Here, data is controlled by the parent component.\n3.It accepts its current value as a prop.\n4.It allows validation control.\n5.It has better control over the form elements and data.\n\n * Uncontrolled * \n\n1.It maintains its internal states.\n2.Here, data is controlled by the DOM itself.\n3.It uses a ref for their current values.\n4.It does not allow validation control.\n5.It has limited control over the form elements and data."

    "22": {
        "question": "Explain the Lists in React.",
        "answer": "Lists are used to display data in an ordered format. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create it in JavaScript. We can traverse the elements of the list using the map() function."
    },
    "23": {
        "question": "What is the significance of keys in React?",
        "answer": "A key is a unique identifier. In React, it is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists. It is useful when we dynamically created components or when the users alter the lists. It also helps to determine which components in a collection needs to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering the entire set of components every time. It increases application performance."
    },
    "24": {
        "question": "How are forms created in React?",
        "answer": "Forms allow the users to interact with the application as well as gather information from the users. Forms can perform many tasks such as user authentication, adding user, searching, filtering, etc. A form can contain text fields, buttons, checkbox, radio button, etc.\n\nReact offers a stateful, reactive approach to build a form. The forms in React are similar to HTML forms. But in React, the state property of the component is only updated via setState(), and a JavaScript function handles their submission. This function has full access to the data which is entered by the user into a form."
    },
    "25": {
        "question": "What are the different phases of React component's lifecycle?",
        "answer": "The different phases of React component's lifecycle are:\n\nInitial Phase: It is the birth phase of the React lifecycle when the component starts its journey on a way to the DOM. In this phase, a component contains the default Props and initial State. These default properties are done in the constructor of a component.\n\nMounting Phase: In this phase, the instance of a component is created and added into the DOM.\n\nUpdating Phase: It is the next phase of the React lifecycle. In this phase, we get new Props and change State. This phase can potentially update and re-render only when a prop or state change occurs. The main aim of this phase is to ensure that the component is displaying the latest version of itself. This phase repeats again and again.\n\nUnmounting Phase: It is the final phase of the React lifecycle, where the component instance is destroyed and unmounted(removed) from the DOM."
    },
    "26": {
        "question": "Explain the lifecycle methods of React components in detail.",
        "answer": "The important React lifecycle methods are:\n\n  * getInitialState(): It is used to specify the default value of this.state. It is executed before the creation of the component.\n\n  * componentWillMount(): It is executed before a component gets rendered into the DOM.\n\n  * componentDidMount(): It is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM. Now, you can do any DOM querying operations.\n\n  * componentWillReceiveProps(): It is invoked when a component receives new props from the parent class and before another render is called. If you want to update the State in response to prop changes, you should compare this.props and nextProps to perform State transition by using this.setState() method.\n\n  * shouldComponentUpdate(): It is invoked when a component decides any changes/updation to the DOM and returns true or false value based on certain conditions. If this method returns true, the component will update. Otherwise, the component will skip the updating.\n\n  * componentWillUpdate(): It is invoked before rendering takes place in the DOM. Here, you can't change the component State by invoking this.setState() method. It will not be called, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.\n\n  * componentDidUpdate(): It is invoked immediately after rendering takes place. In this method, you can put any code inside this which you want to execute once the updating occurs.\n\n  * componentWillUnmount(): It is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently. It is used to clear up the memory spaces such as invalidating timers, event listener, canceling network requests, or cleaning up DOM elements. If a component instance is unmounted, you cannot mount it again."
    },
    "27": {
        "question": "What are Pure Components?",
        "answer": "Pure components introduced in React 15.3 version. The React.Component and React.PureComponent differ in the shouldComponentUpdate() React lifecycle method. This method decides the re-rendering of the component by returning a boolean value (true or false). In React.Component, shouldComponentUpdate() method returns true by default. But in React.PureComponent, it compares the changes in state or props to re-render the component. The pure component enhances the simplicity of the code and performance of the application."
    },
    "28": {
        "question": "What are Higher Order Components(HOC)?",
        "answer": "In React, Higher Order Component is an advanced technique for reusing component logic. It is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. In other words, it is a function which accepts another function as an argument. According to the official website, it is not the feature(part) in React API, but a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature."
    },
    "29": {
        "question": "What can you do with HOC?",
        "answer": "You can do many tasks with HOC, some of them are given below:\n\n* Code Reusability\n* Props manipulation\n* State manipulation\n* Render highjacking"
    },
    "30": {
        "question": "What is the difference between Element and Component?",
        "answer": "* Element *\n\n 1.An element is a plain JavaScript object which describes the component state and DOM node, and its desired properties.\n 2.It only holds information about the component type, its properties, and any child elements inside it.\n 3.It is immutable.\n 4.We cannot apply any methods on elements.\n\n * Component * \n\n 1.A component is the core building block of React application. It is a class or function which accepts an input and returns a React element.\n 2.It can contain state and props and has access to the React lifecycle methods.\n 3.It is mutable.\n 4.We can apply methods on components."
    },
    "31": {
        "question": "Why is it necessary to start component names with a capital letter?",
        "answer": "In React, it is necessary to start component names with a capital letter. If we start the component name with lower case, it will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. It is because, in JSX, lower case tag names are considered as HTML tags."
    },
    "32": {
        "question": "What are fragments?",
        "answer": "In was introduced in React 16.2 version. In React, Fragments are used for components to return multiple elements. It allows you to group a list of multiple children without adding an extra node to the DOM."
    },
    "33": {
        "question": "Why are fragments better than container divs?",
        "answer": "* Fragments are faster and consume less memory because it did not create an extra DOM node.\n* Some CSS styling like CSS Grid and Flexbox have a special parent-child relationship and add <div> tags in the middle, which makes it hard to keep the desired layout.\n* The DOM Inspector is less cluttered."
    },
    "34": {
        "question": "How to apply validation on props in React?",
        "answer": "Props validation is a tool which helps the developers to avoid future bugs and problems. It makes your code more readable. React components used special property PropTypes that help you to catch bugs by validating data types of values passed through props, although it is not necessary to define components with propTypes.\n\nWe can apply validation on props using App.propTypes in React component. When some of the props are passed with an invalid type, you will get the warnings on JavaScript console. After specifying the validation patterns, you need to set the App.defaultProps."
    },
    "35": {
        "question": "What is create-react-app?",
        "answer": "Create React App is a tool introduced by Facebook to build React applications. It provides you to create single-page React applications. The create-react-app are preconfigured, which saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration like Webpack or Babel. You need to run a single command to start the React project, which is given below.\n\n$ npx create-react-app my-app \n\nThis command includes everything which we need to build a React app. Some of them are given below:\n*It includes React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.\n* It includes Autoprefixed CSS, so you don't need -webkit- or other prefixes.\n* It includes a fast, interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.\n* It includes a live development server that warns about common mistakes.\n* It includes a build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and source maps."

        "answer": "There are two possible ways to create a component in React:\n\nFunction Components: This is the simplest way to create a component in React. These are the pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements\n\nClass Components: The class components method facilitates you to use ES6 class to define a component."
    },
    "37": {
        "question": "When do we prefer to use a class component over a function component?",
        "answer": "If a component needs state or lifecycle methods, we should use the class component; otherwise, use the function component. However, after React 16.8, with the addition of Hooks, you could use state, lifecycle methods, and other features that were only available in the class component right in your function component."

        "question": "Is it possible for a web browser to read JSX directly?",
        "answer": "Web browsers can't read JSX directly. This is because the web browsers are built to read the regular JS objects only, and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object.\n\nIf you want a web browser to read a JSX file, you must transform the files into a regular JavaScript object. For this purpose, Babel is used."

        "question": "Why do we need a Router in React?",
        "answer": "React Router plays an important role to display multiple views in a single page application. It is used to define multiple routes in the app. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular Route. So, we need to add a Router library to the React app, which allows creating multiple routes with each leading to us a unique view."

        "question": "How many ways can we style the React Component?",
        "answer": "We can style React Component in mainly four ways, which are given below:\n\n* Inline Styling\n* CSS Stylesheet\n* CSS Module\n* Styled Components"
    },
    "52": {
        "question": "Explain CSS Module styling in React.",
        "answer": "CSS Module is a CSS file where all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. It is available only for the component which imports it, and without your permission, it cannot be applied to any other Components. You can create CSS Module file with the .module.css extension."
    },
    "53": {
        "question": "What are Styled Components?",
        "answer": "Styled-Components is a library for React. It is the successor of CSS Modules. It uses enhance CSS for styling React component systems in your application, which is written with a mixture of JavaScript and CSS. It is scoped to a single component and cannot leak to any other element in the page.\n\nThe styled-components provides:\n\n*Automatic critical CSS\n* No class name bugs\n* Easier deletion of CSS\n* Simple dynamic styling\n* Painless maintenance"

        "question": "What are hooks in React?",
        "answer": "Hooks are the new feature introduced in React 16.8 version that facilitates us to use state and other React features without writing a class."
    },
    "55": {
        "question": "What are the rules you should follow for the hooks in React?",
        "answer": "We have to follow the following two rules to use hooks in React:\n\n* You should call hooks only at the top level of your React functions and not inside the loops, conditions, or nested functions. This is used to ensure that hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders, and it also preserves the state of hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.\n\n* You should call hooks from React functions only. Don't call hooks from regular JavaScript functions."
    },
    "56": {
        "question": "What are forms in React?",
        "answer": "In React, forms are used to enable users to interact with web applications. Following is a list of the most common usage of forms in React:\n\n* Forms facilitate users to interact with the application. By using forms, the users can communicate with the application and enter the required information whenever required.\n* Forms contain certain elements, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc., that can make the application more interactive and beautiful.\n* Forms are the best possible way to take inputs from the users.\n* Forms are used for many different tasks such as user authentication, searching, filtering, indexing, etc."

    "57": {
        "question": "What is an error boundary or error boundaries?",
        "answer": "An error boundary is a concept introduced in version 16 of React. Error boundaries provide a way to find out the errors that occur in the render phase. Any component which uses one of the following lifecycle methods is considered an error boundary. Let's see the places where an error boundary can detect an error:\n\n* Render phase\n* Inside a lifecycle method\n* Inside the constructor\n\n We know that any error inside the render method leads to unmounting of the component so, to display an error that occurs inside the render method, we use error boundaries. When we are not using the error boundary, we see a blank page instead of seeing an error.\n With error boundaries:\n\nWe have specified earlier that error boundary is a component using one or both of the following methods:\n\n * static getDerivedStateFromError\n* componentDidCatch"
    },
    "58": {
        "question": "In which cases do error boundaries not catch errors?",
        "answer": "Following are some cases in which error boundaries don't catch errors:\n\n* Error boundaries don't catch errors inside the event handlers.\n* During the server-side rendering.\n* In the case when errors are thrown in the error boundary code itself.\n* Asynchronous code using setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks."

    "59": {
        "question": "What were the major problems with MVC framework?",
        "answer": "The major problems with the MVC framework are:\n\n* DOM manipulation was very expensive.\n* It makes the application slow and inefficient.\n* There was a huge memory wastage.\n* It makes the application debugging hard."

    "60": {
        "question": "What is Redux?",
        "answer": "Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application state. React uses Redux for building the user interface. The Redux application is easy to test and can run in different environments showing consistent behavior. It was first introduced by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark in 2015.\n\nReact Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple. It subscribes to the Redux store, checks to see if the data which your component wants have changed, and re-renders your component."
    },
    "61": {
        "question": "What are the three principles that Redux follows?",
        "answer": "The three principles that redux follows are:\n\n1. Single source of truth: The State of your entire application is stored in an object/state tree inside a single Store. The single State tree makes it easier to keep changes over time. It also makes it easier to debug or inspect the application.\n2. The State is read-only: There is only one way to change the State is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This principle ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks can write directly to the State.\n3. Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how actions transform the state tree, you need to write reducers (pure functions). Pure functions take the previous State and Action as a parameter and return a new State."
    },
    "62": {
        "question": "List down the components of Redux.",
        "answer": "The components of Redux are given below.\n\n* STORE: A Store is a place where the entire State of your application lists. It is like a brain responsible for all moving parts in Redux.\n* ACTION: It is an object which describes what happened.\n* REDUCER: It determines how the State will change."
    },
    "63": {
        "question": "Explain the role of Reducer.",
        "answer": "Reducers read the payloads from the actions and then updates the Store via the State accordingly. It is a pure function which returns a new state from the initial State. It returns the previous State as it is if no work needs to be done."
    },
    "64": {
        "question": "What is the significance of Store in Redux?",
        "answer": "A Store is an object which holds the application's State and provides methods to access the State, dispatch Actions and register listeners via subscribe(listener). The entire State tree of an application is saved in a single Store which makes the Redux simple and predictable. We can pass middleware to the Store which handles the processing of data as well as keep a log of various actions that change the Store's State. All the Actions return a new state via reducers."
    },
    "65": {
        "question": "How is Redux different from Flux?",
        "answer": "* Redux *\n\n1. Redux is an open-source JavaScript library used to manage application State.\n2. Store's State is immutable.\n3. In this, Store and change logic are separate.\n4. It has only a single Store.\n5. Redux does not have Dispatcher concept.\n\n * Flux *\n\n1. Flux is neither a library nor a framework. It is a kind of architecture that complements React as view and follows the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow model.\n2. Store's State is mutable.\n3. In this, the Store contains State and change logic.\n4. It can have multiple Store.\n5. It has single Dispatcher, and all actions pass through that Dispatcher."
    },
    "66": {
        "question": "What are the advantages of Redux?",
        "answer": "The main advantages of React Redux are:\n\n* React Redux is the official UI bindings for react Application. It is kept up-to-date with any API changes to ensure that your React components behave as expected.\n* It encourages good 'React' architecture.\n* It implements many performance optimizations internally, which allows to components re-render only when it actually needs.\n* It makes the code maintenance easy.\n* Redux's code written as functions which are small, pure, and isolated, which makes the code testable and independent."
    },
    "67": {
        "question": "How to access the Redux store outside a component?",
        "answer": "You need to export the Store from the module where it created with createStore() method. Also, you need to assure that it will not pollute the global window space.\n\nstore = createStore(myReducer)\nexport default store  "
