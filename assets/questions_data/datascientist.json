        "question": "How is Data Science different from traditional application programming?",
        "answer": "Data Science takes a fundamentally different approach to building systems that provide value than traditional application development.\n\nIn traditional programming paradigms, we used to analyze the input, figure out the expected output, and write code, which contains rules and statements needed to transform the provided input into the expected output. As we can imagine, these rules were not easy to write, especially, for data that even computers had a hard time understanding, e.g., images, videos, etc.\n\nData Science shifts this process a little bit. In it, we need access to large volumes of data that contain the necessary inputs and their mappings to the expected outputs. Then, we use data science algorithms, which use mathematical analysis to generate rules to map the given inputs to outputs.\n\nThis process of rule generation is called training. After training, we use some data that was set aside before the training phase to test and check the system’s accuracy. The generated rules are a kind of black box, and we cannot understand how the inputs are being transformed into outputs.\n\nHowever, If the accuracy is good enough, then we can use the system (also called a model).\n\nAs described above, in traditional programming, we had to write the rules to map the input to the output, but in Data Science, the rules are automatically generated or learned from the given data. This helped solve some really difficult challenges that were being faced by several companies."

Its purpose is to quantify the disparity between predicted values and actual values. Minimizing the cost function entails optimizing the model’s parameters or coefficients, aiming to achieve an optimal solution.\n\nLoss function: Loss functions possess significant significance in supervised learning endeavors. They evaluate the discrepancy or error between predicted values and actual labels. The selection of a specific loss function depends on the problem at hand, such as employing mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification tasks.

However, if the amount of missing data is low, then we have several strategies to fill them up.\n\nOne way would be to fill them all up with a default value or a value that has the highest frequency in that column, such as 0 or 1, etc. This may be useful if the majority of the data in that column contains these values.\n\nAnother way is to fill up the missing values in the column with the mean of all the values in that column. This technique is usually preferred as the missing values have a higher chance of being closer to the mean than to the mode.\n\nFinally, if we have a huge dataset and a few rows have values missing in some columns, then the easiest and fastest way is to drop those columns.

        "question": "What is a bias-variance trade-off in Data Science?",
        "answer": "When building a model using Data Science or Machine Learning, our goal is to build one that has low bias and variance. We know that bias and variance are both errors that occur due to either an overly simplistic model or an overly complicated model. Therefore, when we are building a model, the goal of getting high accuracy is only going to be accomplished if we are aware of the tradeoff between bias and variance.\n\nBias is an error that occurs when a model is too simple to capture the patterns in a dataset. To reduce bias, we need to make our model more complex. Although making the model more complex can lead to reducing bias, if we make the model too complex, it may end up becoming too rigid, leading to high variance. So, the tradeoff between bias and variance is that if we increase the complexity, the bias reduces and the variance increases, and if we reduce complexity, the bias increases and the variance reduces. Our goal is to find a point at which our model is complex enough to give low bias but not so complex to end up having high variance."

        "question": "What is RMSE?",
        "answer": "RMSE stands for the root mean square error. It is a measure of accuracy in regression. RMSE allows us to calculate the magnitude of error produced by a regression model. The way RMSE is calculated is as follows:\n\nFirst, we calculate the errors in the predictions made by the regression model. For this, we calculate the differences between the actual and the predicted values. Then, we square the errors.\n\nAfter this step, we calculate the mean of the squared errors, and finally, we take the square root of the mean of these squared errors. This number is the RMSE and a model with a lower value of RMSE is considered to produce lower errors, i.e., the model will be more accurate."

        "answer": "In the SVM algorithm, a kernel function is a special mathematical function. In simple terms, a kernel function takes data as input and converts it into a required form. This transformation of the data is based on something called a kernel trick, which is what gives the kernel function its name. Using the kernel function, we can transform the data that is not linearly separable (cannot be separated using a straight line) into one that is linearly separable."

        "question": "How can we select an appropriate value of k in k-means?",
        "answer": "Selecting the correct value of k is an important aspect of k-means clustering. We can make use of the elbow method to pick the appropriate k value. To do this, we run the k-means algorithm on a range of values, e.g., 1 to 15. For each value of k, we compute an average score. This score is also called inertia or the inter-cluster variance.\n\nThis is calculated as the sum of squares of the distances of all values in a cluster. As k starts from a low value and goes up to a high value, we start seeing a sharp decrease in the inertia value. After a certain value of k, in the range, the drop in the inertia value becomes quite small. This is the value of k that we need to choose for the k-means clustering algorithm."

For example, if a dataset with the weights of babies has a value 98.6-degree Fahrenheit, then it is incorrect. Now, if the value is 187 kg, then it is an extreme value, which is not useful for our model.\n\nIn case the outliers are not that extreme, then we can try:\n\n* A different kind of model. For example, if we were using a linear model, then we can choose a non-linear model\n\n* Normalizing the data, which will shift the extreme values closer to other data points\n\n* Using algorithms that are not so affected by outliers, such as random forest, etc."

        "question": "What is variance in Data Science?",
        "answer": "Variance is a type of error that occurs in a Data Science model when the model ends up being too complex and learns features from data, along with the noise that exists in it. This kind of error can occur if the algorithm used to train the model has high complexity, even though the data and the underlying patterns and trends are quite easy to discover. This makes the model a very sensitive one that performs well on the training dataset but poorly on the testing dataset, and on any kind of data that the model has not yet seen. Variance generally leads to poor accuracy in testing and results in overfitting."

        "question": "What information is gained in a decision tree algorithm?",
        "answer": "When building a decision tree, at each step, we have to create a node that decides which feature we should use to split data, i.e., which feature would best separate our data so that we can make predictions. This decision is made using information gain, which is a measure of how much entropy is reduced when a particular feature is used to split the data. The feature that gives the highest information gain is the one that is chosen to split the data.\n\nLet’s consider a practical example to gain a better understanding of how information gain operates within a decision tree algorithm. Imagine we have a dataset containing customer information such as age, income, and purchase history. Our objective is to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not.\n\nTo determine which attribute provides the most valuable information, we calculate the information gain for each attribute. If splitting the data based on income leads to subsets with significantly reduced entropy, it indicates that income plays a crucial role in predicting purchase behavior. Consequently, income becomes a crucial factor in constructing the decision tree as it offers valuable insights.\n\nBy maximizing information gain, the decision tree algorithm identifies attributes that effectively reduce uncertainty and enable accurate splits. This process enhances the model’s predictive accuracy, enabling informed decisions pertaining to customer purchases."

It does not mean that collaborative filtering generates bad recommendations.\n\nHowever, as collaborative filtering is based on the likes and dislikes of other users we cannot rely on it much. Also, users’ likes and dislikes may change in the future.\n\nFor example, there may be a movie that a user likes right now but did not like 10 years ago. Moreover, users who are similar in some features may not have the same taste in the kind of content that the platform provides.\n\nIn the case of content-based filtering, we make use of users’ own likes and dislikes which are much more reliable and yield more positive results.
